# 3D-mpMRI-PIRADS-EyeTracking-data-share
Open-source eye tracking data and output data from the custom 3D Slicer Module associated with the results presented in the manuscript "Quantitative metrics to characterize radiologists’ search patterns during multiparametric MRI assessment for prostate cancer"

## EyeTrackingData
There are two types of eye tracking data: the export from the Gazepoint Analysis software based on the screen recording stored in the GazepointGUIData folder, and the data from Gazepoint's API stored in the GazepointAPIData folder. The data stored under GazepointGUIData was primarily used for analysis. In the event a screen recording was not collected, the data under GazepointAPIData was used instead. Each data file under a radiologist's folder corresponds to a different study session where the radiologist completed the prostate assessment tasks for a few patients. The entire study was completed within a 2–3 week period for each radiologist. The data is separated by radiologist, the session.

## SlicerModuleData
These files contain the output data from our custom 3D Slicer module during each radiologist's completion of the search for prostate cancer task. The data is separated by radiologist, then patient.
